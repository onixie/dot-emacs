Mar 16, 2011 Pipeline subshell: Bash vs Ksh
When doing pipelines, ksh will run each pipeline in current process, 
in contrary, bash will run each pipeline in a subshell environment.

This difference direct consequnce is when setting some variable in a pipeline in bash,
it may not reflect the value in the parent scripts.

e.g.
------------------------------------------------
echo "bla bla bla.." | while read one two three
do
    result=$one $two $three
done

echo $result
------------------------------------------------

in ksh, you got bla bla bla..
in bash, you got nothing
